# Crwn Clothing



Crwn Clothing is an ecommerce web application that allows users to view, add items to their wishlist or cart, and purchase products using Stripes API.

I built this application using React/Redux for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend, with PostgreSQL to manage the database. I used active model serializer to format my JSON responses, and implemented JSON web user authentication using JSON Web Tokens and the BCrypt library to one-way encrypt user passwords. All styling was accomplished with Sass-compiled CSS and Material UI. I used Nokogiri to web scape ASOS and H&M APIâ€™s product information for the user.

## Current Features:
* User Authentication: Users can securely create a new account and log on onto their existing accounts.
* Once logged in the user is directed to the dashboard, where they can begin shopping for clothing.
* Users can add their items to their cart or add them to their wishlist for future shopping.
* Once in the cart or wishlist a user can remove their items if they wish so.
* After adding items for purchase, users can proceed to the stripe checkout and enter in their card information to process their payment.
