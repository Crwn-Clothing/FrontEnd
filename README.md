# Crwn Clothing Frontend

### Description
Crwn Clothing is an ecommerce web application that allows users to view, add items to their wishlist or cart, and purchase products using Stripes API.

I built this application using React/Redux for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend, with PostgreSQL to manage the database. I used active model serializer to format my JSON responses, and implemented JSON web user authentication using JSON Web Tokens and the BCrypt library to one-way encrypt user passwords. All styling was accomplished with Sass-compiled CSS and Material UI. I used Nokogiri to web scape ASOS and H&M API’s product information for the user.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
